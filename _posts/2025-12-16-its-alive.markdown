I have been **thinking** about making a webpage/blog for myself for a long time. 

For a while I had a website that was more of a portfolio focused on school/technical projects, mostly for recruiters & internships, but I never really ended up finishing it because I just wasn't that interested in developing it. All of that information is already on my github and it just felt repetitive and kind of useless. 

I'm hoping to make this page/blog more about the interesting things going on in my life and school as well as the projects I may be working on in the lab as well as my trips outside.
Honestly this webpage will be more for me than for anyone else, as an outlet to share my life without the constant distraction of other social media platforms.
